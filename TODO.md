## Booking Flow Square Integration 

1. Fix addons not showing in flow 
2. Fix labels to account for new step
3. Make sure staff member selection only shows applicable members
4. Stop querying staff availabilities for dates in the past 
5. Finalize booking creation and sending to Square
6. Figure out CC info??
7. Boatload of errors to fix
8. Need to make sure certain categories don't show up in the booking flow step 1 (Addons, Gift Cards, etc)
9. Figure out how to deal with in-person payments (if that is even something I need to do on my end)


### FRONTEND:

1. Make sure buttons are consistent between steps (currently they're not!)
2. Either remove the images section, or get Dawn to add images via Square
3. Scroll to top on every new step

## Square Shop Integration
